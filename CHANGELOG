CHANGELOG FOR YAFEMS

v0.4
---------------------------------------
- More performance boost due to the implementation of the Cuthill-McKee
algorithm. This algorithm reorders the stiffness matrix matrix and severely
reduces the bandwith. This leads to a huge decrease in time on the solving
stage. If the number of elements is not too big, the solving time can actually
increase a little, but those are the cases that solves in under a second, it
shouldn't be a problem. The piston case sees a reduction in solving time from
almost a minute to 9 seconds.
- Fixed some minor typos here and there.
- I've been trying to implement parallellization using OpenMP, but it seems that
in the loops I've tried it actually takes more time to create the threads,
execute them and then syncing then than the time it takes to do it with a
single thread. This has lead to postpone parallellization for now. Some
commented out code has been left in case I decide to give it a try in the future.
- Windows version released between 0.3 and 0.4.

v0.3
---------------------------------------
- Big performance increase due to internal changes. The stiffness matrix is stored
using the "skyline" method detailed in Finite Element Procedures by Bathe. This
allows great savings in memory and solving time. A new solving algorithm that takes
advantage of this matrix description is used.
- YAFEMS now outputs to standard output the time it takes for several tasks and the
total computed time.

v0.2
---------------------------------------
- Implemented 3D solving using linear tetrahedrons. Although the results are not very
accurate due to this elements, YAFEMS can now solve a 3D case.
- New tutorials for the 3D module added to user manual.
- Typo fixing.

v0.1
----------------------------------------
- First version of YAFEMS. Capable of performing a 2D plane stress-plane strain analysis
using linear triangles.
